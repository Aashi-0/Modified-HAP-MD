    "# Introduction to MOLECULAR DYNAMICS\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computational simulation technique used to study the behavior and \n",
    "movement of atoms and molecules over time. It allows researchers to observe the motion of molecules \n",
    "and the interactions between them, which can provide insight into a wide range of phenomena, including chemical \n",
    "reactions, protein folding, and material properties.In MD simulations, the positions, velocities, and forces acting on individual atoms or molecules are calculated over a period of time using numerical methods. These calculations are based on the laws of classical mechanics, which describe how particles move and interact with each other. By simulating the behavior of molecules at the atomic level, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the physical and chemical properties of materials and biological systems.\n",
